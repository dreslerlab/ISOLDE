                "During daytime, we are rarely confused about our state of mind: we are sure to be awake, and are (mostly) correct about this. During sleep, in contrast, we often fail in judging our own state of mind: even during the most bizarre dream scenario, we typically do not realize that we are dreaming.",
                "The exception from this rule is the phenomenon of Lucid Dreaming: becoming fully aware of the current dream state during ongoing sleep. However, lucid dreaming is rare: half of humanity never experiences a lucid dream, and even those who do have lucid dreams rarely, in most cases less than once per month.",
                "This rarity makes the science of lucid dreaming challenging: most studies include only a few participants, as researchers cannot afford to spend weeks at night in the sleep laboratory to wait for a lucid dream to occur. ",
                "While some people have lucid dreams on a more regular basis, either as a rare talent or through deliberate training, they typically cannot spend their nights for weeks or months in the sleep laboratory either - and only so many frequent lucid dreamers live close to a sleep research laboratory anyway.",
                "However, recent innovations in neurotechnology allow to bring lucid dreaming research from the laboratory ‘into the wild’: wearable EEG headbands that record brain activity during sleep at home.",
                "The International Study on Lucid Dreaming Expertise - or ISoLDE for short - aims to perform such research on the large scale: multiple research groups from six continents collaborate to investigate the brain activity of frequent lucid dreamers all across the world, thus creating the largest EEG dataset on lucid dreaming so far.",
                "If you experience lucid dreams several times a week, please consider joining the study - you will have the opportunity to essentially contribute to the neuroscience of lucid dreaming, and also to join a vibrant community of lucid dreamers and researchers worldwide! "

For the three weeks, participants will attempt to induce LD using their own methods of choice (or no induction strategies in case of frequent spontaneous lucid dreams). ",
